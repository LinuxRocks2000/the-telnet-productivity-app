# The Telnet Productivity App
A telnet server. For a "productivity" app: primarily, this is a way for Linux enthusiasts to waste time

Basic idea-
Go in with telnet. It asks for a space ID, which will probably be a lowercased and dashed version of the space name. It asks for a username or password. Login that way.  
The owner of the space will login as `root` and will be able to create new users - if the user you login as has been newly created, it will ask for a password to use.
